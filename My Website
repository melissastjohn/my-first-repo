We see many websites, magazines and blogs dedicated to women's fashion. However, with this website it will give detail on men's fashion and what is in style for 2014. I hope to accomplish a well developed webpage that gives great detail on styles that are in for guys. I hope to have links that lead to other links, and post pictures to show the viewers of the website the styles I am talkikng about. I want the website to be easy to navigate and have enough content that the viewer is satisfied after visiting the site.
